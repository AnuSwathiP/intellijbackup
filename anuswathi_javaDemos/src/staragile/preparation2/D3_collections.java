//    The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
//    Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
//Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
//A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Array size is fixed,cant able to increase or decrease dynamically,so go for collections which is group of homogenous elements
//        for example when working with Collection objects, such as ArrayList, where primitive types cannot be used (the list can only store objects):
//        Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects
//        Primitive Data Type	Wrapper Class
//        byte	Byte
//        short	Short
//        int	Integer
//        long	Long
//        float	Float
//        double	Double
//        boolean	Boolean
//        char	Character
    }
