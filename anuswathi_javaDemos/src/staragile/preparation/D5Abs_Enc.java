//     Encapsulation is a process of binding or wrapping the data and the codes that
//    operate on the data into a single entity. This keeps the data safe from outside
//    interface and misuse.
//     Abstraction is the concept of hiding irrelevant details. In other words, make the
//    complex system simple by hiding the unnecessary detail from the user.
//     Abstraction is implemented in Java using interface and abstract class
//    while Encapsulation is implemented using private, package-private and protected
//    access modifiers.
//     Abstraction solves the problem in the design level. Whereas Encapsulation solves
//    the problem in the implementation level.
